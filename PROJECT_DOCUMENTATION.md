# Beaver's Choice Paper Company - Multi-Agent System Documentation

## Project Overview

This project implements a production-ready multi-agent system for the Beaver's Choice Paper Company to streamline inventory management, quoting, sales, and financial operations. The system consists of four specialized agents, orchestrated by a main function, and is fully compliant with all project rubric requirements.

## Agent Workflow Diagram

The system follows a hierarchical orchestration pattern with the following architecture:

```
Customer Request ‚Üí Orchestrator Agent ‚Üí Specialized Worker Agents ‚Üí Response
```

- **Orchestrator Agent**: Main coordinator that parses customer requests and delegates tasks
- **Inventory Agent**: Manages stock levels, reorder assessments, and inventory reports
- **Quoting Agent**: Generates competitive quotes with bulk discounts
- **Sales Agent**: Finalizes transactions and manages delivery schedules
- **Financial Agent**: Provides financial reporting and cash flow monitoring

All agents are implemented using the [pydantic-ai](https://github.com/ContextualAI/pydantic-ai) framework and use OpenAI models for reasoning and tool selection. The orchestrator agent coordinates all workflow and delegates tasks to the worker agents.

For the complete workflow diagram and agent architecture, see [WORKFLOW_DIAGRAM.md](WORKFLOW_DIAGRAM.md).

  - `cash_balance_tool_pydantic()`: Monitor current cash position (uses `get_cash_balance()`)

### Tools and Helper Functions

The system utilizes all required helper functions from the starter code:

1. **create_transaction()**: Records sales and stock orders
2. **get_all_inventory()**: Retrieves complete inventory snapshot
3. **get_stock_level()**: Checks specific item stock levels
4. **get_supplier_delivery_date()**: Calculates delivery timelines
5. **get_cash_balance()**: Monitors cash flow
6. **generate_financial_report()**: Creates financial summaries
7. **search_quote_history()**: Finds relevant historical quotes

### Request Parsing Logic

The system uses regex patterns to extract items and quantities from customer requests, ensuring robust parsing for a variety of request formats.

### Pricing Strategy

The system implements intelligent bulk discounting:
- **Large orders** (>5000 items): 10-15% discount
- **Medium orders** (>1000 items): 3-5% discount
- **Small orders** (>100 items): 2% discount

## Evaluation and Reflection

### Dataset and Evaluation Methodology

The multi-agent system was evaluated using the full set of customer requests provided in `quote_requests_sample.csv`. The results of this evaluation are documented in `test_results.csv`, which records the cash balance, inventory value, and system response after each request.

### Rubric Demonstration

- **At least three requests result in a change to the cash balance:**
  - Request 1: Cash balance increases from $45,059.70 to $45,129.30 after a successful order (see test_results.csv row 1).
  - Request 4: Cash increases to $45,128.80 after another successful order (row 4).
  - Request 5: Cash decreases to $45,038.80 after a partial fulfillment (row 5).
  - Many subsequent requests also result in cash balance changes, as seen throughout the file.

- **At least three quote requests are successfully fulfilled:**
  - Request 1: "Order confirmed! Total: $69.60" (row 1)
  - Request 4: "Order confirmed! Total: $24.50" (row 4)
  - Request 10: "Order confirmed! Total: $291.00" (row 10)
  - Request 11, 13, and 14 are also fully fulfilled, exceeding the requirement.

- **Not all requests are fulfilled, with reasons provided or implied:**
  - Request 2: "Unfortunately, we cannot fulfill your complete order due to insufficient inventory. None of the requested items are currently available in sufficient quantities."
  - Request 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18: Partial fulfillments with explanations and restock information.
  - Request 20: "I apologize, but I couldn't identify specific paper products in your request. Please specify the items and quantities you need."

### Reflection on Architecture and Implementation

The agent workflow diagram (see WORKFLOW_DIAGRAM.md) guided the design of a modular, orchestrator/worker agent system:
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Parses requests and delegates tasks to specialized agents.
- **Inventory Agent**: Handles stock checks and reordering.
- **Quoting Agent**: Generates quotes and applies pricing logic.
- **Sales Agent**: Processes sales and manages delivery.
- **Financial Agent**: Tracks cash and generates reports.

This separation of concerns ensures each agent has a clear, non-overlapping responsibility, making the system scalable and maintainable. The use of pydantic-ai and OpenAI models enables flexible, tool-driven reasoning for each agent.

### Evaluation Results and Strengths

- **Robust Transaction Handling**: The system updates cash balance and inventory value dynamically after each transaction, as shown in test_results.csv.
