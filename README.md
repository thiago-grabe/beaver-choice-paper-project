# Beaver's Choice Paper Company - Multi-Agent System

A production-ready multi-agent system designed to streamline inventory management, quoting, sales, and financial operations for the Beaver's Choice Paper Company.

## 🚀 Features

- **Intelligent Request Parsing**: Automatically extracts items and quantities from customer requests
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Applies bulk discounts based on order size
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time stock tracking with automatic reordering
- **Sales Processing**: Seamless transaction handling and delivery scheduling
- **Financial Reporting**: Comprehensive financial monitoring and reporting
- **OpenAI-Powered Agents**: All business logic agents are powered by OpenAI models via the pydantic-ai framework

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of 4 specialized OpenAI-powered agents, orchestrated by a main function:

1. **Inventory Agent**: Stock management and reorder assessment
2. **Quoting Agent**: Quote generation and pricing strategy
3. **Sales Agent**: Transaction processing and delivery management
4. **Financial Agent**: Financial reporting and cash flow monitoring

All agents are implemented using the [pydantic-ai](https://github.com/ContextualAI/pydantic-ai) framework and use OpenAI models for reasoning and tool selection. The orchestrator agent (main function) coordinates all workflow and delegates tasks to the worker agents.
